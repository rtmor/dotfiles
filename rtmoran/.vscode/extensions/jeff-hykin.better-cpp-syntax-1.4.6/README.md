# What does this do?
It improves the highlighting of C++ and C code (See screenshots). 

## How do I use it?
Just install the VS Code extension and the changes will automatically be applied to all C++/C files.

### Normal C++

### Better C++

## What does this do different?
It fixes:
- The issue of single quotes inside #error and #warning being highlighted when then shouldn't be 
- The issue of initilization functions only highlighting the first paraenthese
- The bug that treats the 'and' and 'or' operator as functions (instead of operators) when they are followed by ()'s
- Old C99 function highlighting that broke the standard function highlighting
- The failure of highlighting for the semicolon after namespaces
- The missing operator overloading symbols
- The failure to tag operator overloading functions as functions
- The failure to tag implicit operator overrides
- The marking of some %'s as invalid inside of strings https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues/289
- The highlighting of namespaces with ::'s https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues/260 
- The issue of the C++ syntax depending on (and getting screwed up by) the C syntax
- And many many more issues (#318, #309, #270, #246, etc)

It adds:
- Parameter highlighting
- C++14 literal support (`100'000ms`)
- Better object identification
- Improved scope resultion `::` syntax
- Highlighting of templated function calls `aFunction<int>(arguments)`
- Template definition syntax highlighting (including C++ 2020 syntax)
- Additional specificity for many existing tags
- Tags for the colon in ranged-based for loops
- Many other features

## Is this finished? Can I contribute?
This project is still just getting started. The ruby code is very much a work in progress. It's probably going to be another month before the structure is created. Once the structure is established, maintainance and contributions will be easy.

Planned future fixes/featues:
- Fix more of the syntax-breaking bugs from https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues
- Fix more of the easy-to-fix bugs from https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues
  - Fix multiple inheritance https://github.com/atom/language-c/issues/245
- Start coding patterns according to the offical C++ syntax specifications
- Fix function-pointer tagging
- Add tagging for type-casting statements
- Add tagging for template-usage (rather than only template definition)
- Add tagging for probably-a-custom-type words
- Better support for dereferenced/pointer tagging
- Add support for lambda highlighting (this is going to be tough)

## What if I see a highlighting bug?
Let me know! Post an issue on https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammar
I love regular expressions, and I plan on actively maintaining this.

## So whats the deal with the built-in C++ stynax?
There's missing keywords, misspelled keywords, there's copy-and-pasted patterns, duplicated logic, and groups that were matched but forgot to ever be tagged. The standard tagging for C++ looks like a bunch of hacked-together solutions with no standards, it is very suprising. The regex and pattern matching is so complicated to read that I think nobody wants to change it. I hope to change this by having the json files be generated completely by a ruby file. It makes the regex readable and gets rid of the need to copy and paste patterns.

## Did you write all of this youself?
The ruby code is authored by me, but the .json file is a modifcation of https://github.com/atom/language-c;

## Did you write all the improvements yourself?
Nope, the #error fix was taken from fnadeau's pull request here: https://github.com/atom/language-c/pull/251
Thanks fnadeau! that was a well written soltuion.
